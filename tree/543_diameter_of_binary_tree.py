543. Diameter of Binary Tree

Given a binary tree, you need to compute the length of the diameter of the tree. 
The diameter of a binary tree is the length of the longest path between any two nodes in a tree.
This path may or may not pass through the root.

Note: The length of path between two nodes is represented by the number of edges between them.
