167. Two Sum II - Input array is sorted

Given an array of integers that is already sorted in ascending order, 
find two numbers such that they add up to a specific target number.

The function twoSum should return indices of the two numbers 
such that they add up to the target, where index1 must be less than index2.

Note:

Your returned answers (both index1 and index2) are not zero-based.
You may assume that each input would have exactly one solution and 
you may not use the same element twice.

Example 1:

Input: numbers = [2,7,11,15], target = 9
Output: [1,2]
Explanation: The sum of 2 and 7 is 9. Therefore index1 = 1, index2 = 2.

Example 2:

Input: numbers = [2,3,4], target = 6
Output: [1,3]

Example 3:

Input: numbers = [-1,0], target = -1
Output: [1,2]

class Solution:
    def twoSum(self, numbers: List[int], target: int) -> List[int]:
        i, j = 0, len(numbers) - 1
        while i < j:
            if numbers[i] + numbers[j] == target:
                return [i + 1, j + 1]
            elif numbers[i] + numbers[j] > target:
                j -= 1
            else:
                i += 1

        return [-1, -1]
